As a sociologist, I believe sociology education empowers students to critically examine society and contribute meaningfully to policy-making through rigorous data analysis. By exploring how social structures and individual agency interact across time, students gain a sophisticated understanding of how life course trajectories shape patterns of advantage and disadvantage. Integrating data science with sociological perspectives enables us to uncover complex patterns of inequality over time, providing crucial evidence for policy interventions. This analytical approach equips students with the quantitative and theoretical tools to address systemic inequalities while developing a deeper understanding of how social forces shape individual and societal outcomes.

## Philosophy
------
My goal is to inspire students to harness sociology's analytical power while developing robust data science skills. I create an engaging learning environment where students:

* Learn quantitative methods and statistical techniques while grounding their analysis in sociological theory and frameworks
* Develop critical thinking about social structures and inequality through data-driven investigation
* Apply advanced analytical skills to address real-world policy challenges, transforming research into actionable insights
* Build practical expertise in research design, data analysis, and the systematic study of social phenomena

## Experience
------
Drawing from the experiences below, I have developed an approach that integrates theoretical rigor with practical application, empowering students to critically analyze social phenomena and become impactful agents of change.
