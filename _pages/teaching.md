## Sociology as a Catalyst for Social Change 
Sociology education empowers students to think critically about society and contribute meaningfully to policy-making through rigorous data analysis. By examining the interplay between social structures and individual agency, students learn to understand how historical, economic, and cultural contexts shape human behavior. Integrating data science with sociological analysis allows us to uncover patterns that inform evidence-based policy decisionsâ€”crucial for addressing systemic inequity and promoting social change.

## Teaching Philosophy
My goal is to inspire students to harness sociology's analytical power while developing practical skills in data science. I create an environment where students:

* Learn to integrate quantitative analysis with sociological theory
* Develop critical thinking about social structures and inequality
* Apply their knowledge to real-world policy challenges
* Build practical skills for social research and analysis


## Teaching Experience

# Asian Development Bank Institute, Tokyo
* Designed and led over 50 policy dialogues and training programs
* Collaborated with Stanford University Leadership Academy
* Helped created e-learning programs for government officials
* Facilitated discussions on development practices across Asia

# Summer Institute in Computational Social Science (SICSS)
* Co-organized UCLA's SICSS program
* Delivered lectures on machine learning applications in social sciences
* Taught integration of computational methods with sociological research

Through these experiences, I've developed an approach that combines theoretical rigor with practical applications, preparing students to become thoughtful analysts of social phenomena and effective agents of change.
