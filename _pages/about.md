Welcome! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in [Sociology](https://soc.ucla.edu/) and an M.S. Student in [Statistics and Data Science](https://statistics.ucla.edu/) at UCLA, is forging an academic path at the intersection of sociology, statistics, and data science. I am also a member of [the Social Inequality Data Science Lab (SIDS-Lab)](https://www.sidatasciencelab.org/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Jennie E. Brand](https://www.profjenniebrand.com/) and [Mark S. Handcock](https://handcock.github.io/). 

## Research Focus

My research develops and uses longitudinal causal inference methods at the intersection of social demography and social stratification. To advance social theory, I examine the long-term effects of college completion and disruptive events on life outcomes. This investigation aims to elucidate the mechanisms behind both intra- and inter-group inequalities and stratification.
