Welcome! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in [Sociology](https://soc.ucla.edu/) and an M.S. Student in [Statistics and Data Science](https://statistics.ucla.edu/) at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). I am forging an academic path at the intersection of sociology, statistics, and data science, affiliated with [the Social Inequality Data Science Lab (SIDS-Lab)](https://www.sidatasciencelab.org/) and [the California Center for Population Research](https://ccpr.ucla.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Jennie E. Brand](https://www.profjenniebrand.com/) and [Mark S. Handcock](https://handcock.github.io/). Before coming to UCLA, I worked in public policy think tanks, including [the Asian Development Bank Institute](https://www.adb.org/adbi/main) in Tokyo, Japan.

### Research Interests
My research uses and develops machine learning, statistical analysis, and demographic methods to investigate social stratification & inequality, and social demography. To advance social theory, I analyze the time-varying causal effects of disruptive life events on subsequent socioeconomic outcomes. My work aims to uncover the social processes driving both inter-group and intra-group stratification and inequality across the life course.
