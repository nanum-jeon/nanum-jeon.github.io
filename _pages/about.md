I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Sociology](https://soc.ucla.edu/) and an M.S. student in [Statistics and Data Science](https://statistics.ucla.edu/) at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). I am affiliated with the [Inequality Data Science Lab (IDS-Lab)](https://www.inequalitydatasciencelab.org/) and the [California Center for Population Research (CCPR)](https://ccpr.ucla.edu/). Prior to UCLA, I worked in public policy think tanks, including the [Asian Development Bank Institute](https://www.adb.org/adbi/main) in Tokyo, Japan. I hold an M.P.P. from the University of Tokyo in Japan and a B.A. in Sociology from Ewha Womans University in South Korea.

## Research Interests 
My research focuses on the following key areas: (1) **The intersection of social stratification and life course studies**, using disruptive life events—such as divorce or job displacement—as critical lenses to examine inequality. (2) **Intra-group inequality over the life course**, analyzing how race, gender, and other intersecting identities create divergent trajectories within social groups. (3) **The application and development of statistical and machine learning methods**, advancing sociological research and addressing questions of causality.

My papers have been published in several journals, including the _Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion_, _Journal of Marriage and Family_, and _Social Science Research_. My dissertation research has been recognized with funding and awards, including the [Donald J. Treiman Research Fellowship](https://ccpr.ucla.edu/funding/treiman-research-fellowship/) from the UCLA CCPR and a UCLA Dissertation Award. I have also received a nationally competitive scholarship from the [Kwanjeong Education Foundation](https://www.ikef.or.kr/) in Korea.

Methodologically, I specialize in applying and developing statistical and machine learning approaches to sociological research, with a focus on advancing causal inference methods. At UCLA, I served as an organizer of the [Summer Institute in Computational Social Science (SICSS)-UCLA](https://sicss.io/2023/ucla/), which emphasized the integration of computational methods into social science research and causal inference. 

**I will be on the academic job market for the 2025–2026 academic year**, seeking tenure-track faculty positions in sociology or related fields, as well as postdoctoral opportunities. For further details about my research and teaching, please see my full [CV](/files/CV_NJ.pdf).
