Welcome! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in [Sociology](https://soc.ucla.edu/) and an M.S. Student in [Statistics and Data Science](https://statistics.ucla.edu/) at UCLA, is forging an academic path at the intersection of sociology, statistics, and data science. I am also a member of [the Social Inequality Data Science Lab (SIDS-Lab)](https://www.sidatasciencelab.org/). I am a researcher focused on the long-term impacts of disruptive life events, such as divorce and job loss. Using longitudinal data, my work aims to uncover causal relationships, examining how these events shape individual life paths and affect the dynamics of social stratification. A significant aspect of my research is understanding the influence of these disruptions on labor market involvement and socio-demographic behaviors.
