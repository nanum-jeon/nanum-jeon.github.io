Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Sociology](https://soc.ucla.edu/) and an M.S. student in [Statistics and Data Science](https://statistics.ucla.edu/) at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). I am affiliated with the [Inequality Data Science Lab (IDS-Lab)](https://www.inequalitydatasciencelab.org/) and the [California Center for Population Research](https://ccpr.ucla.edu/). 

Before coming to UCLA, I worked in public policy think tanks, including the [Asian Development Bank Institute](https://www.adb.org/adbi/main) in Tokyo, Japan. I hold an M.P.P. from the University of Tokyo and a B.A. in Sociology from Ewha Womans University in South Korea.
