My research applies and advances statistical, demographic, and machine learning methods to explore social stratification, inequality, and social demography with a strong emphasis on causal inference. I focus on uncovering the social processes that drive both inter-group and intra-group disparities throughout the life course. My work has been published in _Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion_, _Journal of Marriage and Family_, and _Social Science Research_.
