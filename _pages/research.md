My research bridges **two key fields in sociology**. The first examines how **welfare state and mobility regimes** shape life risks and disruptions, fundamentally influencing patterns of social inequality. The second investigates how **social institutions structure life trajectories**, exploring how they can either reinforce or mitigate social stratification. By connecting these distinct areas of inquiry, I examine how life risks unfold over time, materialize, and lead to specific consequences for social inequality.

My research particularly highlights **intra-group inequality by race and gender**. I explore how different experiences with social institutions—including **college education, labor market participation, welfare receipt, and family dynamics** shape social stratification. This approach reveals how inequalities develop not just between different social groups, but also within these groups across the life course.

My research integrates three key perspectives:

* **Life Course Perspective**: How do timing, duration, and sequences of divergent life trajectories create lasting inequalities?
* **Institutional Analysis**: How do welfare state and mobility regimes shape the distribution of life risks and opportunities?
* **Infracategorical Approach**: How do intersecting identities and resources create heterogeneous outcomes within seemingly similar groups?

To capture these complex dynamics, I work with **longitudinal panel data and advance statistical and machine learning approaches**. These methods allow me to model complex temporal relationships and develop new techniques for causal inference, with recent work exploring deep learning applications.

The ultimate aim of my work is to inform civic and policy discussions through rigorous analysis, contributing to the development of more effective social safety nets. By systematically examining how life risks intersect with social inequalities, my research provides evidence to help shape interventions that reduce disparities and support vulnerable populations across the life course.


## Dissertation Projects 
------
My dissertation, _Exploring Employment Patterns, Family Disruption, and Gender Inequality_, examines how disruptive life events, specifically divorce and job displacement, interact with gender to shape post-event social inequality using machine learning approaches. My research reveals how women navigate particular vulnerabilities during life crises, influenced by persistent labor market inequalities and gender role expectations.

* **In Chapter 1 (Post-Divorce Trajectories)**, I examine divorce as a critical turning point that disproportionately disrupts women’s life trajectories. Using sequence analysis, causal inference, and machine learning methods with data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) 1979, I identify modal patterns of post-divorce trajectories in employment, remarriage, and welfare receipt. Through g-computation using machine learning, I demonstrate how these modal trajectories generate cumulative inequality, with their effects further amplified by women’s pre-divorce socioeconomic positions.
* **In Chapter 2 (Job Displacement & Marriage Stability)**, I investigate how the relationship between job displacement and marital stability has evolved across generations with the NLSY-79 and NLSY-97 cohort data, emphasizing heterogeneity among younger cohort women. In the younger cohort, where women’s economic contributions are vital to household stability, job loss may trigger more complex responses based on their role as primary or co-equal earners, the timing of job loss relative to family formation, and their position in an increasingly polarized labor market. Through relative distribution methods, I capture nuanced patterns across the entire distribution of divorce risk.
* **In Chapter 3 (Gender Dynamics After Job Loss)**, I examine the immediate aftermath of job displacement, analyzing how men and women differently adjust their time allocation between the labor market and household work. Using difference-in-differences estimation with the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, my analysis reveals that job displacement is a catalyst for gender specialization, widening disparities in how men and women allocate their time between market work and household responsibilities.
