Life risks and disruptions are shaped by distinct welfare state and mobility regimes across countries, which play a fundamental role in influencing patterns of social inequality. Life course research examines how social institutions shape individual trajectories over time, influencing later outcomes and either reinforcing or mitigating patterns of stratification. Building on these insights, my research bridges social stratification and life course perspectives by analyzing how life risks unfold and materialize over time, leading to specific consequences for social inequality. A key focus of my research is intra-group inequality. I investigate how disparate socioeconomic resources and experiences with social institutions shape patterns of social stratification not only between different social groups but also within seemingly homogeneous groups across the life course. 

In summary, my research integrates three key perspectives:

* **Social Stratification Perspective**: How do welfare state and mobility regimes shape the distribution of life risks and opportunities?
* **Life Course Perspective**: How do timing, duration, and sequences of divergent life trajectories create lasting inequalities?
* **Infracategorical Perspective**: How do disparate socioeconomic resources and experiences create heterogeneous outcomes within seemingly homogeneous groups?

To capture these dynamics, I use **panel data** and advance **statistical and machine learning approaches**. These methods allow me to model complex temporal relationships and develop new techniques for causal inference, with recent work exploring deep learning applications.

The ultimate aim of my work is to inform civic and policy discussions through rigorous analysis, contributing to the development of more effective social safety nets. By examining how life risks intersect with social inequalities, my research provides evidence to help shape interventions that reduce disparities and support vulnerable populations across the life course.
