Life risks and disruptions are profoundly influenced by the distinct welfare state systems and mobility regimes of each country, which play a critical role in shaping patterns of social inequality. Life course research has explored how social institutions structure life trajectories, affecting life outcomes and reinforcing or mitigating social stratification. Building on this foundation, my research explicitly bridges two fields of sociology—social stratification and life course research—by examining how life risks unfold over time, materialize, and lead to specific consequences for social stratification. 

Specifically, my research highlights intra-group inequality by race and gender. Differential attainments or engagements with social institutions—such as college education, welfare receipt, or family dynamics—moderate these stratification processes, contributing to inequalities not only between groups but also within groups across the life course.

To address these complex dynamics over the life course, my work integrates the following approaches:

•	Life course perspective: Investigating how differential engagements with social institutions, as reflected in life course trajectories, moderate stratification processes.
•	Institutional perspective: Examining how welfare state policies and mobility regimes shape inter- and intra-group inequalities.
•	Infracategorical perspective: Highlighting nuance and diversity within specific categories, emphasizing how intersecting identities create varied life course outcomes even within seemingly homogeneous groups.

Driven by a commitment to understanding how social inequalities evolve and compound over time, I work extensively with longitudinal panel data. These datasets capture the temporal dynamics of social phenomena, offering a level of complexity that rivals traditional ‘big data.’ To advance this research, I develop and apply innovative statistical and machine learning methods—particularly deep learning approaches—to model non-linear relationships of time-varying variables for longitudinal causal inference.

The ultimate aim of my work is to inform civic and policy discussions, contributing to the development of robust social safety nets and more targeted, responsive interventions to reduce social disparities.
