Life risks and disruptions are shaped by distinct welfare state and mobility regimes across countries, which fundamentally influence patterns of social inequality. Life course research examines how social institutions structure trajectories over time, affecting outcomes and either reinforcing or mitigating stratification patterns. Building on these insights, my research bridges social stratification and life course perspectives by analyzing how life risks unfold and materialize over time, leading to specific consequences for social inequality. 

A central focus of my research is **intra-group inequality**. I investigate how diverse experiences with social institutions shape patterns of social stratification. This approach not only examines inequalities between different social groups but also uncovers how these disparities develop within groups across the life course. 

In summary, my research integrates three key perspectives:

* **Life Course Perspective**: How do timing, duration, and sequences of divergent life trajectories create lasting inequalities?
* **Institutional Analysis**: How do welfare state and mobility regimes shape the distribution of life risks and opportunities?
* **Infracategorical Approach**: How do intersecting identities and resources create heterogeneous outcomes within seemingly similar groups?

To capture these dynamics, I use **panel data** and advance **statistical and machine learning approaches**. These methods allow me to model complex temporal relationships and develop new techniques for causal inference, with recent work exploring deep learning applications.

The ultimate aim of my work is to inform civic and policy discussions through rigorous analysis, contributing to the development of more effective social safety nets. By examining how life risks intersect with social inequalities, my research provides evidence to help shape interventions that reduce disparities and support vulnerable populations across the life course.


## Dissertation Projects 
------
My dissertation, _Exploring Employment Patterns, Family Disruption, and Gender Inequality_, examines how disruptive life events, specifically divorce and job displacement, interact with gender to shape post-event social inequality using machine learning approaches. My research reveals how women navigate particular vulnerabilities during life crises, influenced by persistent labor market inequalities and gender role expectations.

* **In Chapter 1 (Post-Divorce Trajectories)**, I examine divorce as a critical turning point that disproportionately disrupts women’s life trajectories. Using sequence analysis, causal inference, and machine learning methods with data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) 1979, I identify modal patterns of post-divorce trajectories in employment, remarriage, and welfare receipt. Through g-computation using machine learning, I demonstrate how these modal trajectories generate cumulative inequality, with their effects further amplified by women’s pre-divorce socioeconomic positions.
* **In Chapter 2 (Job Displacement & Marriage Stability)**, I investigate how the relationship between job displacement and marital stability has evolved across generations with the NLSY-79 and NLSY-97 cohort data, emphasizing heterogeneity among younger cohort women. In the younger cohort, where women’s economic contributions are vital to household stability, job loss may trigger more complex responses based on their role as primary or co-equal earners, the timing of job loss relative to family formation, and their position in an increasingly polarized labor market. Using relative distribution methods, I analyze differences in the entire distributions of divorce risk across cohorts.
* **In Chapter 3 (Gender Dynamics After Job Loss)**, I examine the immediate aftermath of job displacement, analyzing how men and women differently adjust their time allocation between the labor market and household work. Using difference-in-differences estimation with the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, my analysis reveals that job displacement is a catalyst for gender specialization, widening disparities in how men and women allocate their time between market work and household responsibilities.
