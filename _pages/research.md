## Research Agenda 
Life risks and disruptions are profoundly influenced by the distinct welfare state systems and mobility regimes of each country, which play a critical role in shaping patterns of social inequality. Life course research has explored how social institutions structure life trajectories, affecting life outcomes and reinforcing or mitigating social stratification. Building on this foundation, my research explicitly bridges two fields of sociology—social stratification and life course research—by examining how life risks unfold over time, materialize, and lead to specific consequences for social stratification. 

Specifically, my research highlights intra-group inequality by race and gender. Differential attainments or engagements with social institutions—such as college education, welfare receipt, or family dynamics—moderate these stratification processes, contributing to inequalities not only between groups but also within groups across the life course.

To address these complex dynamics over the life course, my work integrates the following approaches:

* Life course perspective: Investigating how differential engagements with social institutions, as reflected in life course trajectories, moderate stratification processes.
* Institutional perspective: Examining how welfare state policies and mobility regimes shape inter- and intra-group inequalities.
* Infracategorical perspective: Highlighting nuance and diversity within specific categories, emphasizing how intersecting identities create varied life course outcomes even within seemingly homogeneous groups.

Driven by a commitment to understanding how social inequalities evolve and compound over time, I work extensively with longitudinal panel data. These datasets capture the temporal dynamics of social phenomena, offering a level of complexity that rivals traditional ‘big data.’ To advance this research, I develop and apply innovative statistical and machine learning methods—particularly deep learning approaches—to model non-linear relationships of time-varying variables for longitudinal causal inference.

The ultimate aim of my work is to inform civic and policy discussions, contributing to the development of robust social safety nets and more targeted, responsive interventions to reduce social disparities. 


## Dissertation Research 

Life disruptions do not occur in a social vacuum – their consequences are deeply shaped by pre-existing social inequality. My dissertation, _Exploring Employment Patterns, Family Disruption, and Gender Inequality_, examines how disruptive life events, specifically divorce and job displacement, interact with gender to shape post-event social inequality using machine learning approaches. Women occupy a particularly vulnerable position in navigating life crises, influenced by persistent gender inequalities in the labor market and enduring normative expectations about gender roles within the family. For instance, divorce not only represents the loss of a partner but often triggers substantial economic vulnerability for women, reflecting unending gender inequalities in labor market outcomes. Similarly, job displacement, beyond immediate earnings losses, can significantly alter women’s economic power within marriages and potentially intensify gender specialization, as households often resort to traditional divisions of labor in response to economic uncertainty. These life disruptions serve as critical windows for examining how gender both constrains and shapes subsequent life trajectories. These trajectories, in turn, have significant implications for generating post-event social and gender inequality as they interact with pre-existing disparities that further moderate individuals’ responses and outcomes. Against this backdrop, my dissertation is structured into three chapters.

* In Chapter 1, I examine divorce as a critical turning point that disproportionately disrupts women’s life trajectories. Using sequence analysis, causal inference, and machine learning methods with data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) 1979, I identify modal patterns of post-divorce trajectories in employment, remarriage, and welfare receipt. Through g-computation using machine learning, I demonstrate how these modal trajectories generate cumulative inequality, with their effects further amplified by women’s pre-divorce socioeconomic positions.
* In Chapter 2, I investigate how the relationship between job displacement and marital stability has evolved across generations with the NLSY-79 and NLSY-97 cohort data, emphasizing heterogeneity among younger cohort women. In the younger cohort, where women’s economic contributions are vital to household stability, job loss may trigger more complex responses based on their role as primary or co-equal earners, the timing of job loss relative to family formation, and their position in an increasingly polarized labor market. Through relative distribution methods, I capture nuanced patterns across the entire distribution of divorce risk.
* In Chapter 3, I examine the immediate aftermath of job displacement, analyzing how men and women differently adjust their time allocation between the labor market and household work. Using difference-in-differences estimation with the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, my analysis reveals that job displacement is a catalyst for gender specialization, widening disparities in how men and women allocate their time between market work and household responsibilities.
  
Together, these three chapters illuminate that while women’s responses to life disruptions are structured by gender, the interactions between their responses and pre-event resources contribute to broader patterns of stratification. By identifying mechanisms through which disruptive events reinforce social and gender inequality, this work aims to inform public policy that mitigates the stratifying effects of life course disruptions.
