### Research Interests
My research applies and develops statistical, demographic, and machine learning methods to investigate social stratification & inequality, and social demography. My research aims to uncover the social processes driving both inter-group and intra-group stratification and inequality across the life course. My work has been published in _Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion_, _Journal of Marriage and Family_, and _Social Science Research_.
