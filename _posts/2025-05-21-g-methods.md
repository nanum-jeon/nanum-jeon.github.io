This tutorial aims to replicate g-methods explained in [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6074945/) by Naimi, A. I., Cole, S. R., and Kennedy, E. H (2017)[^1] using **R**. Originally, the paper used SAS to demonstrate g-methods.

The empirical setting is to treat HIV with a therapy regimen ($$A$$) in two time periods ($$t = 0, t = 1$$). Additionally, we measure the time-varying confounder, HIV viral load ($$Z$$) at times $$t = 0$$ and $$t = 1$$. Note that this time-varying confounder is measured prior to the treatment administered at each time period. Also, we assume $$Z$$ at time 0 is 1 (high, bad health condition) for all subjects. Our outcome is the CD4 count (cells/mm$$^3$$) observed at $$t = 2$$. 

Thus, we have:

Under the identifying assumptions described in [the paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6074945/), we will estimate the average casual effect of always taking treatment ($$a_0 = 1, a_1 = 1$$), compared to never taking treatment ($$a_0 = 0, a_1 = 0$$) in both time periods. For notation, we are using subscripts to indicate time periods.


``` r
# Read packages 
library(tidyverse)
library(ascii)
```

We' will begin with the standard linear regression to peak the crude differences between always-treated and never-treated in their outcome. 

```r
# Replication

# Data in Table 1 
# A0: Treatment at time 0 (for HIV)
# Z1: HIV viral load measurement prior to time 1 (Higher: Worse health condition)
# A1: Treatment at time 1
# Y: Mean of CD4 counts 
# N: Number of subjects 


a0 <- c(0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1)
z1 <- c(0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1)
a1 <- c(0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1)
y <- c(87.288, 112.107, 119.654, 144.842, 105.282, 130.184, 137.720, 162.832)
n <- c(209271, 93779, 60657, 136293, 134781, 60789, 93903, 210527)

data <- data.frame(a0, z1, a1, y, n)
```

### Replicates for Table 1
| a0| z1| a1|       y|      n|
|--:|--:|--:|-------:|------:|
|  0|  0|  0|  87.288| 209271|
|  0|  0|  1| 112.107|  93779|
|  0|  1|  0| 119.654|  60657|
|  0|  1|  1| 144.842| 136293|
|  1|  0|  0| 105.282| 134781|
|  1|  0|  1| 130.184|  60789|
|  1|  1|  0| 137.720|  93903|
|  1|  1|  1| 162.832| 210527|


Now, we fit the data with standard linear regression models to replicate Table 2. 

## Standard Linear Regressions
```r
# Section 1
# Standard linear regression models in Table 2 
# Not considering standard error estimation 

# Crude model 
lm_1 <- lm(y ~ a0 + a1 + a0*a1, data = data, weights = n)

# Z-Adjusted model 
lm_2 <- lm(y ~ a0 + a1 + a0*a1 + z1, data = data, weights = n)

# A0 only model 
lm_3 <- lm(y ~ a0, data = data, weights = n)

# Z1-Adjusted A0 Only Model
lm_4 <- lm(y ~ a0 + z1, data = data, weights = n)

# A1 Only Model
lm_5 <- lm(y ~ a1, data = data, weights = n)

# Z1-Adjusted A1 Only Model
lm_6 <- lm(y ~ a1 + z1, data = data, weights = n)
```

We now check the crude difference in mean CD4 count for the always treated compared to the never treated. In the first model, $$\hat{\beta} = 60.96$$ as reported in [the paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6074945/). In model two, $$\hat{\beta} = 43.01$$, which is slightly larger than as it is reported. This estimate is the $$Z_1$$-adjusted difference in mean CD4 count for the same contrast. The results from other four models are reported in Table below. 

In the next post, we will move onto fitting g-methods to the data in Table 1, beginning with g-formula. 

```r
table2 <- data.frame(model = c("m1", "m2", "m3", "m4", "m5", "m6"), 
                     beta1 = c(lm_1$coefficients["a0"] + lm_1$coefficients["a1"] + lm_1$coefficients["a0:a1"], 
                               lm_2$coefficients["a0"] + lm_2$coefficients["a1"] + lm_2$coefficients["a0:a1"],
                               lm_3$coefficients["a0"],
                               lm_4$coefficients["a0"],
                               lm_5$coefficients["a1"],
                               lm_6$coefficients["a1"])) %>% 
  mutate(beta1 = round(beta1, 2))
```

|model | beta1|

|m1    | 60.96|
|m2    | 43.01|
|m3    | 27.08|
|m4    | 18.03|
|m5    | 38.91|
|m6    | 25.01|
